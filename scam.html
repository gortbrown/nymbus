             <h2>How to spot scams</h2>
            <p>Spotting scam emails, even the most convincing ones, is easier than you'd think. One way to check if an email is a scam is to look at the email address. If the email is from a company like Facebook or Google, check the extension (part after the @) and see if it matches the website's url. For example, if it is from facebook, then check to see if the email address ends in "facebook.com" or "*any word*.facebook.com. If it's different (like facebook.social) then it's a scam. If it's an email from within your own company or school, then check if the extension matches your work or school email. And if it's from a person, make sure it's actually the person they say they are. If it's someone you don't know, or you don't have a way to confirm, be careful. If they're asking for banking info, login info, or any other peronal info, then DON'T GIVE IT TO THEM!</p>

             <h2>What to do if you've been scammed</h2>
             <p>If the sender was pretending to be a friend or a coworker, then let them know so you can double check that if for sure wasn't them, and they can let others who might have gotten the email that it's a scam. If it’s from a company like Facebook or Google, check that you or your friends or family haven’t gotten or fallen for this email. DELETE THIS EMAIL! If you or someone else has fallen for a scam, change your passwords and make sure nothing unusual has happened in your bank accounts or online accounts.

             <h2>How this works</h2>
             <p>This takes information from the email you received to determine if it is a scam. It uses info like the sender’s email, and checks it against other emails from companies in our database, or an email from your workplace if its from a coworker. It will then offer tips to avoid falling for scams to make them easier to spot in the future.</p>
